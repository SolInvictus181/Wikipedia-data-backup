# Wikipedia Scraper

## Overview

The Wikipedia Scraper is a Python script that allows you to scrape content from Wikipedia pages and save it to a Word document. This script is particularly useful for researchers, students, or anyone who wants to collect information from Wikipedia articles for offline use.

## Requirements

Before running the script, make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests`: To make HTTP GET requests to Wikipedia pages.
- `BeautifulSoup`: To parse HTML content.
- `docx`: To create and save Word documents.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 python-docx
Usage
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the wikipedia_scraper.py file.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing wikipedia_scraper.py.

Run the script using Python:

bash
Copy code
python wikipedia_scraper.py
The script will start scraping content from the Main Page of English Wikipedia by default. You can change the url variable in the script to specify a different Wikipedia page if needed.

The scraped content will be saved to a Word document named wikipedia_scraped.docx in the same directory as the script.

Customization
You can customize the script to suit your needs:

Change the url variable to scrape content from a different Wikipedia page.
Modify the script to save the output with a different filename or in a different format.
Adjust the parsing logic to extract specific information from Wikipedia pages.
Note
Please be mindful of Wikipedia's terms of use and consider the legality and ethical implications of scraping content from the site. Make sure to respect copyright and licensing restrictions.
